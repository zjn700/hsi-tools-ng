    <h2 id='1'>GETTING STARTED </h2>
    
    <h3>Welcome to the Human Systems Integration Risk Management Tool (HSI-RMT).  This software suite consists of two sub-tools designed to guide Human Systems Integration (HSI) Analysts/Practitioners, Program Managers (PMs), and Chief Engineers, etc. through the process of accomplishing HSI best practices throughout system development.  The first, the HSI Capabilities and Requirements Tool (HSI-CART) is designed to assist MAJCOM HSI Cells with the appropriate developmental planning and pre-Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) activities, such as Concept Development and Analysis of Alternatives.  The second, the Program Risk Assessment Tool is designed to assist the system program office (SPO) with integrating HSI throughout the JCIDS process and acquisition life cycle, from Material Solution Analysis to Disposal planning.  In this first section, we will introduce HSI and cover the basics of creating an account, logging in to your account, and basic navigation through the tool.

    <h2 id="1.1">1.1 Introduction to Human Systems Integration</h2>
    
    <p>AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering defines Human Systems Integration as “a disciplined, unified, and interactive systems engineering approach to integrate human considerations into the system development, design, and life cycle management to improve total system performance and reduce total costs of ownership.”  Those human considerations span nine U.S. Air Force recognized HSI domains: 
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Human Factors Engineering – Design characteristics for human capabilities and limitations 
        </li>
    
        <li>Manpower – Assessment of the human capital requirements (manning mix) necessary to operate, maintain, and support the system. 
        </li>
    
        <li>Personnel – Assessment of the attributes (knowledge, skills, and abilities) required to operate, maintain, and support the system. 
        </li>
    
        <li>Training – design and development of instruction, resources, and support required to impart system end users with the required knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to operate, maintain, and support the system. 
        </li>
    
        <li>Environment – Assessment of those operational environmental factors and how they impact system design, as well as how the design impacts the operational environment. 
        </li>
    
        <li>Safety – Assessment of system design characteristics and associated procedures that serve to minimize mishap potential. 
        </li>
        <li>Occupational Health – Assessment of system design features that serve to minimize the risks for injury, illness, or disability, and enhance job performance. 
        </li>
    
        <li>Survivability – Consideration of system design features which reduce the likelihood for death or serious injury, to include consideration for hostile environments, fratricide, and emergency egress. 
        </li>
    
        <li>Habitability – Integrated considerations of the system and associated facilities’ impact social interactions, morale, quality of life, safety and comfort, etc. to sustain maximum performance. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Human Systems Integration is a unique discipline in that is it both a technical and managerial philosophy.  Per Department of Defense Instruction 5000.02, program managers are required to plan for and implement HSI through the product lifecycle.  The earlier HSI is introduced, the more likely it is to reap the long-term benefits of risk mitigation, reduced redesign and rework, mishap reduction, etc. and achieve the desired life cycle cost savings.  If properly included in system development, Analysts and Practitioners integrate and examine the risks and tradeoffs amongst the nine domains balance against life cycle cost considerations to provide consultation and decision making support to the Program Manager, ensuring that human considerations are adequately accounted for.  In this manner, developers are able to drive total system performance and minimize total life cycle cost. 
    </p>
    
    <p>HSI is not just another name for Human Factors or just “good Systems Engineering”.  Rather, Human Factors is just one of the disciplines that Analysts integrates – HSI includes so much more.  In fact, a primary role of the Analyst/Practitioner is to integrate each of their own domains as well as those from other functional leads to advise their Program Managers and Systems Engineers on the integrated tradeoffs.
