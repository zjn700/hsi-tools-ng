  <h2 id='1'>1. GETTING STARTED </h2>

  <p>Welcome to the Human Systems Integration Risk Management Tool (HSI-RMT).  This software suite consists of two sub-tools 
  designed to guide Human Systems Integration (HSI) analysts/practitioners, program managers, and Chief Engineers through the 
  process of performing HSI best practices throughout system development.  
  </p>
  
  <p>The first sub-tool, the HSI Capabilities and Requirements Tool (HSI-CART), is designed to assist MAJCOM HSI Cells with 
  the appropriate developmental planning and pre-Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) activities, such 
  as Concept Development and Analysis of Alternatives.  
  </p>
  
  <p>The second, the Program Risk Assessment Tool, is designed to assist the system program office with integrating HSI throughout 
  the JCIDS process and acquisition life cycle, from Material Solution Analysis to Disposal planning.
  </p>
  
  <p>In this first section, we will introduce HSI and how to get started using the tool by launching the tool, creating an account, signing 
  into the HSI-RMT, adding a project, and selecting a tool and questionnaire. In the second section, we will cover how to use the HSI-RMT, 
  which includes editing projects, answering questions, creating and editing integration eveluations, reviewing and printing reports, 
  editing your profile, and logging out of the tool. Keyboard shortcuts will be at the end of this manual.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="1.1">1.1 Introduction to Human Systems Integration</h2>

  <p>AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering, defines Human Systems Integration as “a disciplined, unified, and interactive systems 
  engineering approach to integrate human considerations into the system development, design, and life cycle management to improve total 
  system performance and reduce total costs of ownership.”  Those human considerations span nine U.S. Air Force recognized HSI domains:

  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Human Factors Engineering – Design characteristics for human capabilities and limitations.
    </li>

    <li>Manpower – Assessment of the human capital requirements (manning mix) necessary to operate, maintain, and
      support the system.
    </li>

    <li>Personnel – Assessment of the attributes (knowledge, skills, and abilities) required to operate, maintain, and
      support the system.
    </li>

    <li>Training – design and development of instruction, resources, and support required to impart system end users
      with the required knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to operate, maintain, and support the system.
    </li>

    <li>Environment – Assessment of those operational environmental factors and how they impact system design, as well
      as how the design impacts the operational environment.
    </li>

    <li>Safety – Assessment of system design characteristics and associated procedures that serve to minimize mishap
      potential.
    </li>
    <li>Occupational Health – Assessment of system design features that serve to minimize the risks for injury, illness,
      or disability, and enhance job performance.
    </li>

    <li>Survivability – Consideration of system design features which reduce the likelihood for death or serious injury,
      to include consideration for hostile environments, fratricide, and emergency egress.
    </li>

    <li>Habitability – Integrated considerations of the system and associated facilities’ impact social interactions,
      morale, quality of life, safety and comfort, etc. to sustain maximum performance.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Human Systems Integration is a unique discipline in that is it both a technical and managerial philosophy. Per Department 
  of Defense Instruction 5000.02, program managers are required to plan for and implement HSI through the product lifecycle. 
  The earlier HSI is introduced, the more likely it is to reap the long-term benefits of risk mitigation, reduced redesign and 
  rework, mishap reduction, etc. and achieve the desired life cycle cost savings. If properly included in system development, 
  analysts and practitioners integrate and examine the risks and tradeoffs amongst the nine domains balance against life cycle 
  cost considerations to provide consultation and decision making support to the program manager, ensuring that human considerations 
  are adequately accounted for.  In this manner, developers are able to drive total system performance and minimize total life cycle cost.

  </p>

  <p>HSI is not just another name for Human Factors or just good systems engineering. Rather, Human Factors is just one of the 
  disciplines that analysts integrates – HSI includes much more.  In fact, a primary role of the analyst/practitioner is to 
  integrate each of the HSI domains as well as those from other functional leads to advise program managers and systems engineers 
  on the integrated tradeoffs.

  <h2 id="2.4">2.4 Reviewing and Printing Reports</h2>

  
  <h3>General</h3>
    <p>Click the Review menu item in the top Navigation Bar to go to the Review page. The Review Page
    displays all of your input from the questionnaire. There are separate sections for "Questions and Answers" 
    and "Trade-Off Analysis". Questions/Answers can be sorted in three ways: </p>
    <ul class="with-bullets">
      <li>By risk only</li>
      <li>By domain, then risk</li>
      <li>By domain - all questions</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h3>Sorted "By risk only"</h3>
    <p>The "By risk only" sort order displays all risks from highest to lowest risk level regardless of domain.
      This is also the default sort setting. If there are multiple answers with the same risk level number, then they
      are sorted in numerical order (Domain/Tab sequence number, then question number).</p>

  <p class='figure-label'>Figure 30. Review: By risk only</p>

  
  <h3>Sorted "By Domain, then risk"</h3>
    <p>The "By Domain, then risk" sort order displays risks sorted first by domain sequence number, then from highest risk level to lowest
      within that domain. If there are multiple answers with the same risk level (1 through 25), 
      then the question/answers within that ranking are sorted in numerical order.</p>
  
  <h3>Sorted "By Domain - all questions"</h3>
    <p>The "By Domain - all questions" sort order displays all questions and answers in numerical order (first by
